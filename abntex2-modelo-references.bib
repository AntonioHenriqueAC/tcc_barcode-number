abstract = "The surface heat transfer coefficients of steel billet play very important roles in the accurate heat transfer model. However, these heat transfer coefficients are difficult to be fixed. The main work of this paper focuses on identifying these heat transfer coefficients by solving the inverse heat transfer problem. In order to estimate these heat transfer coefficients better, this paper presents an improved difference evolution algorithm. The SAE1007 steel billet is used to conform the validity of this algorithm. With the help of the surface temperature measurement, this algorithm can identify these heat transfer coefficients effectively. Comparing with the difference evolution algorithm, this improved algorithm can reduce iterative number and has better convergence. Due to the horrible production environment, there are some outliers in the measured values. To eliminate these outliers, the weight least square method is also introduced. Finally, the corrected heat transfer coefficients are used to enhance the accuracy of the heat transfer model, which is applied to predict the solidified shell thickness of steel billet. The predicted results are confirmed by the actual industrial data."

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.By the virtue of blooming automation industry and wireless connectivity, all the devices within the home can be connected. This improves the comfort, energy efficiency, indoor security, cost savings of the home. Small and constrained embedded devices are used to remotely monitor the conditions within home and control the home appliances. In such case, power consumption and network bandwidth become a major concern. We need a low power device that transmits messages through a less verbose protocol. Owing to the ubiquitous availability of WiFi, all the appliances within home can be connected through a common gateway. This paper presents an overview of a light weight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. In the prototype, we attempt to implement MQTT on ESP8266, a WiFi based development board. Sensors and actuators are connected to ESP8266 and a Mosquitto based MQTT broker is established for remote monitoring and control.},

Particularly in the cloud, the microservices architecture approach seems to be an ideal complementation of container technology at the PaaS level However, there is currently no secondary study to consolidate this research. We aim here to identify, taxonomically classify and systematically compare the existing research body on microservices and their application in the cloud. We have conducted a systematic mapping study of 21 selected studies, published over the last two years until end of 2015 since the emergence of the microservices pattern. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework. This results in a discussion of the agreed and emerging concerns within the microservices architectural style, positioning it within a continuous development context, but also moving it closer to cloud and container technology.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.Water is always a crucial part of everyday life. Due to global environmental situation, water management and conservation is vital for human survival. In recent times, there were huge needs of consumer based humanitarian projects that could be rapidly developed using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In this paper, we propose an IoT based water monitoring system that measures water level in real-time. Our prototype is based on idea that the level of the water can be very important parameter when it comes to the flood occurrences especially in disaster prone areas. A water level sensor is used to detect the desired parameter, and if the water level reaches the parameter, the signal will be feed in realtime to social network like Twitter. A cloud server was configured as data repository. The measurement of the water levels are displayed in remote dashboard.},

@article{RisteskaStojkoska2017,
	abstract = {Although Internet of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability. We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home solutions.},

	abstract = {Resumo: A {\'{a}}gua n{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} inesgot{\'{a}}vel, mas, a maioria dos seres humanos ainda tem insistido em fazer uso da {\'{a}}gua de forma desenfreada, muitas vezes nem a usam, apenas desperdi{\c{c}}am. Estudos comprovam que se houver continua{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e/ou crescimento do desperd{\'{i}}cio terse -{\'{a}} uma situa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o insustent{\'{a}}vel no futuro pr{\'{o}}ximo, onde haver{\'{a}} escassez de {\'{a}}gua em todo o mundo. No entanto, t{\^{e}}m sido desenvolvidos diversas maneiras de reciclar e reutilizar {\'{a}}gua que precisam ser amplamente difundidas e implantadas o mais r{\'{a}}pido poss{\'{i}}vel em tudo e por todos, contribuindo assim para o desenvolvimento sustent{\'{a}}vel. Palavras-chave: {\'{A}}gua. Reuso. Atividades dom{\'{e}}sticas. Introdu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o O crescimento populacional e as altera{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es clim{\'{a}}ticas aceleram a redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da disponibilidade de {\'{a}}gua em determinadas regi{\~{o}}es. Como uma boa pr{\'{a}}tica pode ser feito o reciclo e o reuso da {\'{a}}gua em vez de descarta-la de forma desenfreada e na maioria das vezes contaminada no meio. Segundo MORELLI (p{\'{a}}g.4, 2005), o crescente consumo de {\'{a}}gua tem feito do reuso planejado uma necessidade primordial. Essa Pr{\'{a}}tica deve ser considerada parte de uma atividade mais abrangente que {\'{e}} o uso racional da {\'{a}}gua, o qual inclui tamb{\'{e}}m, o controle de perdas, redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do consumo de {\'{a}}gua e a minimiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da gera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de efluentes.},
